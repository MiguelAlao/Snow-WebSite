	<h1>Biography</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>I was born in 1981, started playing hockey with 5 years old and started skiing with age of 10.</p>
	<p>Due to the very litle amount of snow on my origin country, I played hockey until the 21 years old.</p>
	<P>In the mean time, the transition from the skates to the skis, happened on a quiet and peacful way.</P>
	<p>Then, as soon as I got some independency, I also started to go on winter trips with my friends.</p>
